# Requirements

Medical datasets will be required as it will be used to train and test the AI System. Technology will be needed since our project will be developed in python using libraries such scikit-learn, TensorFlow and more for machine learning and natural language. The AI system must look at patient information, such as symptoms, scans, medical history, and lab results. It should give suggestions for possible conditions, and doctors and nurses must be trained to use it properly. The system must keep patient data safe, have a reliable internet connection, and use easy-to-operate software and hardware. It should also be updated and checked to make sure it works properly.

# Constraints

Quality of Data – The AI can only provide reliable predictions if patient information is correct and complete. Missing or incorrect records may lead to wrong suggestions.
Training and Use – Doctors, nurses, and staff need proper training to use the system well. If they are not comfortable with new technology, system use may be slow.
Privacy and ethics - Our AI system will follow laws like POPIA to protect patient’s data.
