# Requirements

Medical datasets will be required as it will be used to train and test the AI System. Technology will be needed since our project will be developed in python using libraries such scikit-learn, TensorFlow and more for machine learning and natural language. The AI system must look at patient information, such as symptoms, scans, medical history, and lab results. It should give suggestions for possible conditions, and doctors and nurses must be trained to use it properly. The system must keep patient data safe, have a reliable internet connection, and use easy-to-operate software and hardware. It should also be updated and checked to make sure it works properly.

# Constraints

Quality of Data – The AI can only provide reliable predictions if patient information is correct and complete. Missing or incorrect records may lead to wrong suggestions.
Training and Use – Doctors, nurses, and staff need proper training to use the system well. If they are not comfortable with new technology, system use may be slow.
Privacy and ethics - Our AI system will follow laws like POPIA to protect patient’s data.


# Risks
Incorrect Diagnosis: There is a risk that the AI system might return wrong results when checking symptoms or records. If that happens patient could receive wrong advice or delayed treatment.
System Downtime: Problems with the internet or hardware could stop the AI from working when needed.
Resistance from Healthcare staff: Doctors, nurses or other staff around health care sector may be worried that AI will replace them and take their jobs.so this can slow down the implementation of AI system

# Tools and Techniques

Data collection and integration
The system will collect information from patient records, lab results, scans, and medical histories. It will combine data from hospitals, clinics, and electronic health records. The patient data may include symptoms, past illnesses, test results, and imaging scans. Historical medical information will also be used to help the AI make more correct predictions.

AI Tools
-Python with libraries like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Spacy, Pands, Numpy, and Matplotlib will be used for machine learning, data analysis and visualization.
-Github it will help us with version control and managing tasks as a team
-Jupiter Notebook/Vs code we will use them for coding environments

Techniques
-Classification models will help us with predictions 
-Natural Language processing will be used to understand and analyse patient-reported symptoms
-Time-series analysis will study patient history
-Data pre-processing a technique that will be used to clean and improve the data

Data Protection
Data will be kept safe and shared securely to protect privacy and follow rules.
