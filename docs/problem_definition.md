# Problem definition
## What is the problem?
In healthcare, the biggest challenge is not having enough doctors especially in public hospitals and rural clinics, which causes delays in treatment because they have to handle a high numbers of patients and have little time with each patient. A patient may have complicated symptoms or a medical history that can be difficult for doctors or nurses to figure out faster, which can cause other patients to wait in long queues for long hours. Currently doctors overwork leading to stress and  less efficiency.


## How Relevant is it to the theme?
This AI solution fits the theme because it uses artificial intelligence to help healthcare by making diagnoses faster. By using this AI the project will help support doctors, improve quality health support, and also making healthcare more accessible to everyone. Analyzing symptoms, medical histories, or scans reduces doctor’s workload and helps patients get treatment sooner. This helps when there aren’t enough doctors and makes healthcare faster.


## How Beneficial will it be to solve the problem?
Solving this problem will greatly improve healthcare by making diagnosis and treatment faster, which helps patients recover sooner. It will reduce waiting long hours in the hospitals and clinics, allowing services to run more smoothly. Doctors and nurses will get support with routine checks, giving them more time to focus on serious cases and reducing their stress and risk of burnout. The use of AI can also improve accuracy in diagnosis by comparing symptoms and medical histories with large databases, which lowers the chance of human errors.
This will also save costs by avoiding unnecessary tests and long hospital stays. Importantly, AI can bring healthcare support to rural and under-resourced areas where doctors are few, making healthcare more accessible and fair. Overall, it will benefit both patients and medical staff, leading to a stronger and more efficient healthcare system.
