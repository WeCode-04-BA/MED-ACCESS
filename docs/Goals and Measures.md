# Business objectives

Our main goal is to fill the gap caused by not having enough doctors, ensuring that patients are still attended to quickly and helping doctors to handle more patients easily by using AI for diagnosis and monitoring, and also freeing doctors to concentrate on urgent and complex cases. When there are not many doctors, AI can give an early check, so people can still get care. Use AI to give faster diagnoses and monitoring, so patients spend less time waiting in hospitals and clinics.

# Success criteria
The AI project will be successful if at least waiting times for patients is cut by 40% and Doctors work load is reduced by 30% ,at least 70% of patients must be satisfied with the service, and also if they spend less time waiting in hospitals and clinics because AI helps give faster diagnoses and monitoring. The AI is successful if it helps reduce doctorsâ€™ workload in hospitals where there are only a few doctors, and if patients spend less time waiting for diagnoses and treatment at clinics.
