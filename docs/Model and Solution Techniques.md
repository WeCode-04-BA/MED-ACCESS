# Model Evaluation for Accuracy

The AI model will be evaluated through standard machine learning validation techniques:

Train/Test Split or Cross-Validation – Ensuring model generalizability.

Accuracy Metrics (depending on task):

Classification : Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Confusion Matrix Analysis – To measure true positives vs false negatives (important in medical diagnosis).

 This ensures both statistical accuracy and clinical relevance.

# Time Series Analysis on Data

Why Time Series?

South African healthcare faces patterns over time (e.g., HIV testing rates, TB case trends, hospital admissions during flu season, medicine stockouts). AI time series analysis can forecast these and support better planning.

# Techniques Used

ARIMA / SARIMA – For seasonality in disease outbreaks.
LSTM / GRU (Deep Learning) – For long-term dependencies in healthcare trends.

Prophet (Facebook’s model) – For interpretable forecasts of patient inflow and medicine demand.

Sample / Example Time Series Analysis

Use Case: Predicting monthly HIV viral load testing rates in Gauteng.

Data: Historical testing records , with variables like number of tests, clinic closures, electricity outages, and funding levels.

# Analysis Process

Trend Detection – Identify overall growth/decline in testing rates.

Seasonality – Detect cyclical patterns.

Forecasting – Predict next 12 months of testing demand.

# Model Output

Predicted decline in testing during power outages.
