# Natural Language Processing ,Speech Recognition or Speech Synthesis

-Our project can integrate NLP to make the system more user-friendly and relevant to health care. Our dataset user's 0 and 1 values for symptoms , but in real life people describe their health in words. NLP CAM turn those words into structured symptoms our AI model understands

* Relevance to the Theme:
-Health care can be improved if patients can explain their symptoms naturally. With NLP and speech tool , patients don't need to select from long lists .they can type or talk to the system.

* Relevance to the proposed solution:
NLP - if someone types "I have chest pain and shortness of breath" the system will pick out the important symptoms and match them to the dataset.
Speech recognition - as optional patients can say their symptoms, and the system will turn the speech into text to analyse.
Speech  Synthesis - as optional the system can speak the results and precautions , helping patients who can't read easily.

* Achievabilty
-These features are achievable with existing Python libraries
-NLP: NLTK, spacy
-Speech Recognition: SpeechRecognition
-Speech Synthesis - pyttsx3,gTTS


# Deep learning
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses a network called neural networks with many layers to learn patterns from large amounts of data. It will help in healthcare by looking at medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to find diseases such as pneumonia, tumors, or broken bones. It can also study patient histories and test results to predict health problems. For MED-Access, deep learning helps the AI give more accurate diagnoses by learning from many past cases and medical images, helping doctors make faster and better decisions.

# Chatbot
A chatbot can serve as the main interface between patients and the system, making healthcare assistance more interactive and  more accessible to both parties. 
Instead of navigating complex menus, patients can simply chat with the bot to describe their symptoms, ask health-related questions, or request guidance.
The chatbot will use NLP to understand the patientâ€™s input, deep learning to make accurate predictions, and speech synthesis to provide spoken responses if needed.
This creates a conversational experience where patients feel like they are speaking to a virtual health assistant, reducing barriers to care and making the system easier for everyone to use.
