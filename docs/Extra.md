# Natural Language Processing ,Speech Recognition or Speech Synthesis

-Our project can integrate NLP to make the system more user-friendly and relevant to health care. Our dataset user's 0 and 1 values for symptoms , but in real life people describe their health in words. NLP CAM turn those words into structured symptoms our AI model understands

* Relevance to the Theme:
-Health care can be improved if patients can explain their symptoms naturally. With NLP and speech tool , patients don't need to select from long lists .they can type or talk to the system.

* Relevance to the proposed solution:
NLP - if someone types "I have chest pain and shortness of breath" the system will pick out the important symptoms and match them to the dataset.
Speech recognition - as optional patients can say their symptoms, and the system will turn the speech into text to analyse.
Speech  Synthesis - as optional the system can speak the results and precautions , helping patients who can't read easily.

* Achievabilty
-These features are achievable with existing Python libraries
-NLP: NLTK, spacy
-Speech Recognition: SpeechRecognition
-Speech Synthesis - pyttsx3,gTTS
