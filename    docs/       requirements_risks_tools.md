### Requirements
`Medical datasets` will be required as it will be used to train and test the `AI` System. `Technology` will be needed since our project will be developed in `python` using libraries such `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` and more for machine learning. The `AI` system must look at patient information, such as symptoms. It should give suggestions for possible conditions, and doctors and nurses must be trained to use it properly. The system must keep patient data safe, have a reliable internet connection, and use easy-to-operate software and hardware. It should also be updated and checked to make sure it works properly.


### Constraints
* Quality of Data – The `AI` can only provide reliable predictions if patient information is correct and complete. Missing or incorrect records may lead to wrong suggestions.
* Training and Use – Doctors, nurses, and staff need proper training to use the system well. If they are not comfortable with new technology, system use may be slow.
* Privacy and ethics - Our `AI` system will follow laws like `POPIA` to protect patient’s data.

### Risks
 * Incorrect predictions: There is a risk that the `AI` system might return `wrong results` when checking symptoms. If that happens patient could receive wrong advice or delayed treatment.
 * System Downtime - Problems with the internet or hardware could stop the `AI` from working when needed.In some areas in `south Africa` internet connection is still a problem this might slow down our `AI`
 * Residence from Healthcare staff - Doctors, nurses or other staff around health care sector may be worried that `AI` will replace them and take their jobs hence the percentage of unemployment is high in `South Africa`.so this can slow down the implementation of `AI` system
 * trainig - mostly rural citizens especially elderly people will find it hard to use our `AI`.Our AI in some areas will require a lot of training that would be costy and require a lot of time or someone to always stand by it for helping those who are not used to electronics

### Tools and Techniques

AI Tools

* Python with libraries like `Scikit-learn`, `Tensorflow`, `Pandas`, `Numpy`, and `Matplotlib` will be used for machine learning, data analysis and visualization.
* `Github` it will help us with version control and managing tasks as a team
* `Jupiter Notebook/Vs code` we will use them for coding environments

Techniques
* `Classification models` will help us with predictions
